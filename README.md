--Hi there! I'm Jaqueline Nunes 👋
I'm a passionate web developer and a dedicated learner on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I'm especially enthusiastic about UX/UI design and building accessible web experiences that truly work for everyone. My current toolkit includes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm always eager to dive into new challenges.

#What I'm Up To
I'm currently focused on building scalable web applications and exploring the exciting world of e-learning projects. I'm also keen on contributing to open source and being part of the wider developer community.
My learning journey is a continuous one! Right now, I'm diving deeper into advanced JavaScript, exploring the power of Jamstack, getting hands-on with SvelteKit, and sharpening my understanding of Software and API Architecture.

#My Goals
My ultimate aim is to become a senior software engineer, where I can continue to build impactful and user-friendly applications. I'm also passionate about leveraging technology for good and aspire to work with "tech for good" companies that are making a positive difference in the world.
